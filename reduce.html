  <center> <h1> Measures to Reduce Unemployment </h1> </center>
<h3> Here are some measures which can help to reduce unemployment:- <br><br>
  
1.Change in industrial technique <br><br>
 Production technique should suit the needs and means of the country. It is essential that labour intensive technology should be encouraged in place of capital intensive technology.<br><br>
2.Full and more productive employment <br><br>
The main objective of country's employment policy should be to increase employment opportunities and productivity of labour. <br><br>
3.Increase in production <br><br>
Upward production means an increase in production if there is a shortage of power in the market, and downward production means a decrease in production in case of excess production in the market. In fact, stochastic manufacturers compensate for deviations from contract production by accessing the equilibrium phase.<br><br>
4.Population control <br><br>
Population control is the practice of artificially maintaining the size of any population. It simply refers to the act of limiting the size of an animal population so that it remains manageable, as opposed to the act of protecting a species from excessive rates of extinction, which is referred to as conservation biology <br><br>
