<h1> Types of Unemployment </h1>
<h3> The following are the types of unemployment:-  </h3>
  <h3>
  1.Frictional unemployment <br><br>
Frictional unemployment is a type of short-term unemployment. Frictional unemployment happens when a person is voluntarily job searching or searching for a new career. Frictional unemployment isn't necessarily a bad thing. In fact, because frictional unemployment is voluntary, it can be a sign of a healthy economy. <br><br>
2.	Structural unemployment <br><br>
Structural unemployment is long-lasting unemployment that comes about due to shifts in an economy. This type of unemployment happens because though jobs are available, there's a mismatch between what companies need and what available workers offer.<br><br>
3.	Seasonal unemployment <br><br>
Seasonal unemployment describes a situation where workers are unemployed at certain times of the year when demand has decreased. Although unemployment is always problematic, seasonal unemployment doesn't last - eventually, the peak season of a given industry arrives and many workers become employed once again. <br><br>
4.	Voluntary unemployment<br><br>
Voluntary unemployment is a situation in which someone chooses to not work, either because they will not take a job with low pay, or they are satisfied with the amount they receive from the government in benefits while not working. Voluntary unemployment refers to voluntary non-working. <br><br>
5.	Geographical unemployment<br><br>
Geographical immobility occurs when workers are not willing or able to move from region to region, or town to town. Geographical mobility is made worse by immense house price variation between regions. <br><br>
