<h1> Causes of Unemployment</h1>
<h3> 
 1.Caste system <br><br>
The work is denied for particular caste in certain territories. Mostly, the work isn't given to the deserving applicants yet given to the individual belonging to a specific caste. So this creates unemployment. <br><br>
2.Slow economic growth<br><br>
A long-accepted principle of economics is that, when the economy grows slowly, unemployment rises. Back in the early 1960s, economist Arthur Okun showed that for every point by which gross domestic product (GDP) grows below its potential, unemployment tends to rise one-half a percentage point. <br><br>
3.Increase in population<br><br>
According to the literatures, population growth is supposed to have a direct relationship with unemployment given that the working population is growing (holding the factors effecting working population negatively) because an increase in population will means an increase in the supply of labour to the labour market. <br><br> 
4.Slow growth in industrialization<br><br>
A long-accepted principle of economics is that, when the economy grows slowly, unemployment rises. <br><br>
5.Cause of under employment<br><br>
The main causes of underemployment include skill mismatch, unqualified graduates, obsolete school curricula, and technological advancements. Layoffs and unequal supply and demand for workers due to economic recessions and exponential population growth also contribute to underemployment. <br><br>
